#SNG Arsenal

This is my first Minecraft mod made using [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/) API. My intention for making this mod is to get myself into Minecraft modding. This mod adds SNG Arsenal into [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/), including new tools, armor, and more. The IDE I use to make this mod is [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

##Mod Details
The SNG Ore starts spawning from y = 16. The rest of the items are similar in application to vanilla Minecraft items. The SNG Block works as a beacon base block and the SNG Ingot works as a beacon payment item.

##Info for Fabric
A version for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) might be available in the future, but this is a project made just for fun and was never meant to be anything big.
