SNG Arsenal
===========
This is my first Minecraft mod made using Forge API. My intention for making this mod is to get myself into Minecraft modding. This mod adds SNG Arsenal into Minecraft, including new tools, armor, and more. The IDE I use to make this mod is Eclipse IDE.

The SNG Ore starts spawning from y = 16. The rest of the items are similar in application to vanilla Minecraft items. The SNG Block works as a beacon base block and the SNG Ingot works as a beacon payment item.

A version for Fabric might be available in the future, but this is a project made just for fun and was never meant to be anything big.
