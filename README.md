# SNG Arsenal (Forge 1.19.4)

This is my first Minecraft mod made using [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/) API. My intention for making this mod is to get myself into Minecraft modding and learn Java among other things. This mod adds SNG Arsenal into [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/), including new tools, armor, and more. The IDE I use to make this mod is [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

## Mod Details
- SNG Ores spawn similarly to Diamond Ore, with maximum of 5 ores per vein.
- SNG Block is TNT proof, while Condensed SNG Block is wither proof.
- SNG Block and Condensed SNG Block work as beacon base blocks, and the SNG Ingot and Condensed SNG Ingot work as beacon payment items.
- Crafting recipes are similar to vanilla Minecraft items, plus:
	- Condensed SNG Ingot is crafted using 8 SNG Ingots in an O-shape.
	- Condensed SNG Block is crafted by using either 9 Condensed SNG Ingots or 8 SNG Blocks in an O-shape.
	- Raw SNG Block can be smelted/blasted directly into SNG Block but takes as long as smelting/blasting 9 Raw SNGs normally.

More details can be found in [changelog.txt](https://github.com/StarSNG25/SNG-Arsenal/blob/1.19.4-forge/changelog.txt).
