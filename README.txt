SNG Arsenal
===========
This is my first Minecraft mod made using Forge API. My intention for making this mod is to get myself into Minecraft modding. This mod adds SNG Arsenal into Minecraft, including new tools, armor, and more. The IDE I used to make this mod is Eclipse IDE.

A version for Fabric might be available in the future, but this is a project made just for fun and was never meant to be anything big.
